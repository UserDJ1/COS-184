    "Jupyter Notebooks are a vertical pile of cells. Cells are either \"Markdown\" or \"Code\" (there are two other types, but we can ignore them for now). You can run cells, one at a time, by clicking on them and then running them with <code>Cell->Run Cells</code> or clicking on the \"Run\" button -- it's just to the left of the black square on the toolbar above. You can run either Markdown or Code cells, but running Code cells is more exciting. You can edit the contents of a Markdown cell by double-clicking on it. To see what a Markdown cell looks like, run it. You can edit the contents of a Code cell by clicking in it.\n",
