    "Python's lists and dictionaries are important ways of representing <i>aggregates,</i>: objects with potentially more than one value. Lists represent <i>unlabeled</i> data: you pick out individual values with an index, a number that represents the position of the value in the list. Dictionaries represent <i>labeled</i> data: you pick out individual values with a <i>key,</i> which is unique within the dictionary. A key is just a unique immutable value itself. \n",

    "Now we're going to revise <code>myGifts</code> to include a bit more information so that gift givers will know how to get what you want. For each item in the list we'll include several <i>attributes:</i> the name of the store that sells it (a <code>string</code>), the store address (a <code>string</code>), and the unit price (a <code>float</code>). We could just put this in a list, but that would mean that a giver would have to know the position of each attribute in the list. Let's make it a dictionary instead. The keys will be <code>'store'</code>, <code>'addr'</code> and <code>'unit_price'</code>. Oh, we'll also need a key <code>'quantity'</code> since otherwise there won't be a good place to keep it.\n",

You can make the values anything you want, but they should be of the right type. For example, the dictionary for the key <code>pair of red socks</code> might look like<br>\n",
